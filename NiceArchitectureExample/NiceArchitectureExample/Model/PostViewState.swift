/// A ViewState is a value type read from the ViewModel by a View.
/// It could be a simplification or reorganization of a model type, for example here
/// the PostViewState combines the `Post` and `User` objects into a single type
/// that can be inserted directly into the list.
/// A ViewState may not be necessary if the mapping between model and view is straightforward.
